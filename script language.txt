entity1 has entity2 -  true if entity has item



Entities:

	entity.name

		add box = 
			box.xy = location of xy, with entity.xy = 0,0
	entity.speed = 200-300 or so.
	entity.[action]Location = offset from the entity's xy, which is where other entities
		will move to when performing [action] on the entity.
